Here are some projects I have had fun working on in the past:

**GAMS to Python**

A project in converting Computable General Equilibrium models from a proprietary GAMS format to the open source Pyomo format which can be run from python.

[[Documentation](https://jasonjensen.github.io/GAMS-to-python/)], [[Code](https://github.com/jasonjensen/GAMS-to-python)].


**Generative ML bird sounds**

In order to learn more about how to work with the inner parts of ML models, I played around with splicing and grafting networks to generate chirps. See write a post about it [here](https://medium.com/p/41628e72efb2).


**tomatotimer.app**

My partner wanted a tomatotimer with a tick-tock sound during work times, so I decided to take it on as a project to learn about Progressive Web Apps. The result is a focus timer with and without sound that can be controlled from the phone's lock screen.

**callmyMP.ca**

This site uses the Twilio backend to make it easy for Canadians to call their federal Member of Parliament. After entering a postal code and phone number, the user received a call after which the call is connected to the MP's office.
